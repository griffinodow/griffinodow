# Griffin's GitHub Portfolio üëã

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Griffin! üëã Currently, I'm honing my skills as a Software Engineer at Autodesk, where I specialize in building scalable and high-performance systems using React and Node.js. Outside the professional sphere, I love to explore the creative side of tech. One such exploration led me to initiate Sonafied, a passion project aimed at enabling creatives to craft and share character cards. In both my professional journey and personal projects, I strive to solve complex problems and take on new challenges.
